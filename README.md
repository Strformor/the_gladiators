# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Ancient Roman gladiators to answer key questions about their survival, success, and public favor. Using various statistical techniques and models, we will investigate factors such as patron wealth, gladiator age, equipment quality, and crowd appeal techniques to predict outcomes like survival rates and victories. The project will also explore the possibility of predicting public favor based on gladiatorial traits.

The analysis will be conducted using Python and relevant data analysis libraries, with the primary dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project will provide insights into the dynamics of gladiatorial combat and the influence of different factors on outcomes.
