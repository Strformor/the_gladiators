# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Ancient Roman gladiators to answer key questions about their survival, success, and public favor. Using various statistical techniques and models, we will investigate factors such as patron wealth, gladiator age, equipment quality, and crowd appeal techniques to predict outcomes like survival rates and victories. The project will also explore the possibility of predicting public favor based on gladiatorial traits.

The analysis will be conducted using Python and relevant data analysis libraries, with the primary dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project will provide insights into the dynamics of gladiatorial combat and the influence of different factors on outcomes.

# Research Questions:
Are younger gladiators more likely to win or survive than older ones?

What factors most influence whether a gladiator survives (e.g., health status, patron
wealth, equipment quality)

How do gladiators with different levels of patron wealth compare in terms of equipment quality and survival rates?

Can public favor be predicted from attributes such as crowd
appeal techniques and social standing?

# Installation Instructions
To run the analysis and explore the dataset, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:

Matplotlib: For generating visualizations such as graphs and plots.
Pandas: For handling data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations, particularly for data cleaning and preprocessing.
After setting up the virtual environment, install Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib using pip (Python's package installer).

Run the following command in your terminal: "pip install pandas numpy matplotlib"

# Usage Instructions
Running the Analysis:
Download the necessary dataset (available on Kaggle or included in the repository).
Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script in the analysis/ directory.
Run the cells in sequence to perform the data analysis for each research question.
